## INTRODUCTION
MERN is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. Among these technologies Mongo DB is a database system, Node JS is a back-end runtime environment, Express JS is a back-end web framework and React is a front-end framework.

    Mongo DB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a No SQL database program, Mongo DB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. Mongo DB is developed by Mongo DB Inc., and is published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

*  #### EXPRESS JS <img src="https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/tags/images/000/000/359/landscape/expressjslogo.png" height="25" width="40"  align="left" >
    Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

    The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together with Mongo DB database and AngularJS frontend framework.

* #### REACT JS <img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-3/426/react_js-512.png" height="25" width="25" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 0px 15px;" >
    React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

    React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

* #### NODE JS <img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/nodejs-1/512/nodejs-512.png" height="30" width="40" align="left" style="margin: 0px 5px 0px 8px" >
    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
